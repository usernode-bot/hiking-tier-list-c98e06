# Hiking Tier List — notes for Claude Code

This app runs on **Homeroom**. If you're Claude Code
editing this repo, read the platform conventions before making
changes:

**Platform conventions (authoritative, always current):**
https://app.onhomeroom.com/claude.md

Fetch that URL at the start of each session — it's the single source
of truth for platform-wide behavior (auth model, `USERNODE_ENV`,
public/private tables, "don't `git push`", etc.). The hosted copy is
updated in place when platform rules change, so fetching it gives you
today's rules, not a stale snapshot.

When running inside Homeroom's dev-chat, those same conventions are
already injected into your system prompt, so the fetch is a no-op in
that path — but it's the right reflex when someone runs Claude Code
against this repo locally or from another harness.

## Connector permission prompts

This repo ships `.claude/settings.json`, which allows the **read-only**
Homeroom connector calls (`mcp__homeroom__get_*`,
`…__list_*`, `…__whoami`) so they stop prompting one at a time. Everything
that acts — filing a request, opening or advancing a proposal — still asks.
Claude Code applies those rules only after you accept the
workspace trust dialog, which lists them for review. See `.claude/README.md`
for the whole story, including what to do if you are still being prompted
(usually: your connector is registered under a different name than the rules
assume).

## Check that this checkout is current

You may be working in a fork of this app whose `main` is behind the app's
canonical repository, and nothing in the checkout says so: `git fetch origin`
compares the fork with itself. This matters before you **read** code to answer
a question about how the app behaves now, not only before you edit it.

The canonical repository is named in `.claude/homeroom-canonical-repo`. Check against
it, not against `origin`:

```sh
git fetch "$(cat .claude/homeroom-canonical-repo)" main
git merge-base --is-ancestor FETCH_HEAD HEAD && echo current || echo behind
```

`behind` means this checkout does not contain the canonical `main`. To answer
a question, read the canonical code instead (`git show FETCH_HEAD:<path>`,
`git grep <pattern> FETCH_HEAD`). To change code, start from the exact base
commit your Homeroom work order gives, and never merge or rebase onto the
canonical `main` yourself: which commit a change is diffed against decides
what the group votes on. With the Homeroom connector, `get_checkout_status`
answers the same question.

A session-start hook (`.claude/hooks/homeroom-freshness.sh`, see `.claude/README.md`) runs
this check for you and tells you when you are behind. It is silent offline, so
its silence is not proof the checkout is current. Inside Homeroom's dev-chat
the platform fixes the base commit, and none of this applies.

## Starter template: Hiking tier list

This app was created from Homeroom's ready-made **Hiking tier list**.
A tier list of the group's favorite hikes: anyone adds one, everyone drags them into tiers, and the group's ranking shows where each lands. It works as it is, and it is a starting point, not a fixed
product: keep what the people building this app want and change the rest
freely.

Where things are:

- `api.js`: this app's routes and its tables (`tier_items` and `tier_votes`).
  `server.js` mounts it after the sign-in check and runs `migrate()`
  on boot, which also seeds a few obviously fake rows in a staging preview.
- `public/index.html` and `public/app.js`: the screen.
- `dapp.json` `tests`: the checks every proposal runs. Keep them passing,
  and change them when you change what they look for.

Update `README.md` when what the app does changes.

Keep the `usernode-dev-console@1` forwarder `<script>` and the bridge
`<script>` when rewriting the HTML: both are platform infrastructure.
The screen is built from the design kit, which is not placeholder either:
keep building with it, and fill in "## Design" below with the first change
that gives this app a look of its own.

The screen has a light and a dark look and follows the viewer's Homeroom
theme, switching live when they change it: the theme `<script>` right after
the bridge tag sets a `dark` class on `<html>`. Keep that script, and give
everything you build both looks (the design kit's colour tokens carry both), unless one
fixed look is the point of this app, like a game's own scene; then say so
under "## Design" below. Unless a request asks for one, add
no theme picker: the viewer's Homeroom setting is the control. "The
platform's light/dark theme inside the app frame" in the platform
conventions has the details.

If a rule below this line conflicts with the hosted conventions, the
hosted conventions win. This file is **app-specific** — write down
things about *this* app that belong in the repo: product intent,
data-model quirks, style preferences, opt-in policies (e.g. which
tables you've marked private), etc.

## About Hiking Tier List

A hiking tier list

_(add a sentence or two more of product context here so Claude Code has a
shared understanding of what this app is for)_

## Design

This app's look. The first real version fills in the blanks; every later
change follows it, and updates it when a request changes the look on purpose.

- **Palette:** _(name the accent, any second colour and the neutrals, e.g.
  "accent: tomato red; second: basil green; neutrals: warm greys")_
- **Signature element:** _(the one thing on screen drawn from this app's
  subject, which no other app would have)_
- **Type scale:** `text-title`, `text-heading`, `text-body`, `text-small`
  _(change their sizes in `tailwind.config.js` if you must, not their number)_
- **One fixed look:** _(only for an app drawn as its own scene, such as a
  game: which look, and why. Otherwise delete this line.)_

The kit is in `styles/tailwind-input.css`: colour tokens with a light and
a dark value (named in `tailwind.config.js`), and a few components
(`btn-primary`, `btn-secondary`, `field`, `list` and `list-row`,
`card`, `section-label`, `skeleton`, `state-empty`, `state-error`).
Re-theme by changing the token values there, keeping every text pair at
4.5:1 or more in both looks.

- Colour comes only from the tokens (`bg-ground`, `bg-surface`,
  `text-fg`, `text-muted`, `border-line`, `bg-accent` with
  `text-on-accent`, ...): never a raw hex value or a stock palette class.
- Tap targets are at least 44 px; the buttons and fields already are.
- A field's label says what it is; its placeholder, if any, is an example
  that says so ("e.g. 5.0"), never a bare value that could pass for one
  already entered.
- Every screen that loads data has honest loading, empty and error states.
  Never show the empty state while loading or after a failure; an error says
  what failed, what still works, and offers Retry.
- Seed obviously fake staging demo data so the populated screen can be seen
  ("Staging mock data" in the platform conventions).
- No cards in cards, no uppercase eyebrows, no emoji as icons.

## App-specific conventions

_(optional — e.g. "all currency values stored as integer cents, not
floats"; "the `posts` table is append-only"; "avoid adding new
dependencies"; etc.)_
